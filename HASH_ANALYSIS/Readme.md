# HASH ANALYSIS

To compare the different hash codes and hash functions used for strings as well as numbers.We found the best techniques for given sample data of numbers and strings and experimented the constants used in various hash functions.

## Getting Started

The project contains the source code as well as results of some of the experiments. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

          
* The code is complied by the command g++ main.cpp as main.cpp is its main file.
* The header files included are number_map.hpp and name_map.hpp.
* The input files are names.txt and numbers.txt .

```
g++ main.cpp -o hash
```

The input files data can be chaged to get the results for that set of input data.The results of the programme are given in the output.txt and observations are given in the RESULTS.txt.

```
less output.txt
```
